                "Crabs are also known as 'spiders of the sea' in many countries. Like spiders, crabs have legs that bend at joints.",
                "Crabs can walk slowly in any direction, but move sideways when they need to hurry.",
                "Crabs help sustain coral reefs by cleaning away debris that would be otherwise harmful.",
                "Crabs provide a valuable food source to a wide range of other creatures. They are an important part of their ecosystem.",
                "There are over 6,700 recognized species of crab worldwide. Roughly 10% are false crabs with subtle differences to most, while the majority are true crabs.",
                "For most of every species of crab that exists, the total number of specimen are unknown.",
                "Crabs have existed since the Jurassic era, over 200 million years ago.",
                "Crabs are decapod crustaceans. This means they have 10 legs, a short tail, are covered in a chitinous shell and have a single pair of claws.",
                "All crabs are invertebrates. This means they don't have a spine! Their shell provides both support for their body and protection from predators.",
                "Crabs have antennae known as 'feelers' attached to their head that act as sensory organs to allow for explore for food and keep track of their surroundings.",
                "Some crabs take advantage of the humidity in the air to help them locate scents, as well as the ocean.",
                "The smallest crab to exist are called pea crabs, which is only a few millimeters wide.",
                "The largest crabs that exist are Japanese spider crabs, which can have a legspan of up to 4 meters (about 13 feet).",
                "The brish-clawed shore crab, discovered as a non-native species in the Netherlands, has small tufts of paintbrush-like hair on its claws.",
                "Take a visit to the Wadden Sea, between the northwestern shore of continential Europe and the nearby archipelago Frisian Islands, to find the rare and exotic Asian shore crab. Despite being called 'Asian', these crabs live in the unique mudflat wetlands just beyond the limits of the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark.",
                "The lifespan of every crab varies according to its species. Blue crabs live only one to eight years, while a Japanese spider crab can live from 50 to 100 years. On average, crabs live about 3 years",
                "A properly cared-for domestic crab can live as a pet much longer than crabs in the wild.",
                "The first pair of each crabs' 10 total legs grow into their claws, which are also called chelae.",
                "After a fight, a crab may lose a leg or a claw. In time -- usually, about a year -- their limb will grow back.",
                "Crabs are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Some species feed primarily on algae, while others feed on worms, mollusks, fungi, bacteria, other crustaceans and organic non-living material.",
                "Most crabs have very soft, delicate mouths, which are incapable of breaking down the food they eat. Instead of chewing, they use their stomachs to break up their food in order to then digest it, grinding internal masticators together by contracting it.",
                "Marine crabs breathe underwater using a set of gills. Land crabs have cavaties in their bodies that act as lungs to allow them to breathe air.",
                "Male and female crabs can be sexed by looking at their abdomens, called the pleon. In males, the pleon is narrow and more angular, while in females, it is more broad and round.",
                "Female crabs tend to have smaller claws than male crabs.",
                "Different crabs species attract a mate in many interesting ways -- chemically, visually, acoustically and even vibratorally.",
                "All crabs are oviparous, which means they reproduce by laying eggs.",
                "After mating, blue crabs and several other species deposit about two million eggs. In a two week period, they eggs develop into larva.",
                "Crabs do not grow in a normal linear fashion, similar to other animals. Their hard shell does not grow with them, so they must shed it, a process known as molting.",
                "Most crabs shed their shells six or seven times in their first year of life. After that, they usually do so only once or twice a year.",
                "Most crabs have a very great number of natural predators.",
                "Hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs, and crab lice are not true crabs. Horseshoe crabs in particular, however, are not crabs, or even crustaceans -- they have their own class called Merostomata, are closely related to spiders, and haven't changed since the dinosaur era.",
                "Crabs are eaten by humans very often, and make up 20% of all marine crustaceans that are farmed or caught around the world.",
                "Roughly 1.5 million tons of crab is consumed annually in restaurants and homes all over the world.",
                "Crabs can be prepared in dozens of ways by different cuisines around the world. Some species are taken, cooked, and eaten whole, while others are caught for their large claws and legs.",
                "In 2005, Norwegian scientists concluded that crustaceans could not feel pain. However, a later 2009 study from Queens University in Belfast found that hermit crabs not only reacted to electric shock, but demonstrated a memory of it as well. Contemporary science agrees that crabs and all crustaceans should be treated with the same care as any vertebrate.",
                "Crab meat is extremely high in vitamin B12. Only 2-3 ounces of crab meat is enough to meet an average adult's daily B12 requirement.",
                "Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behavior patterns. They can communicate by drumming or waving their pincers.",
                "Some species of crab are solitary, while others live in groups. The collective name for a group of crabs is 'cast'.",
                "Crabs live in every ocean, in freshwater, and on land; however, most crab species are found in more shallow ocean waters, where they tend to inhabit rocky pools and reefs.",
                "Australian Rangers built a bridge over a road at Christmas Island to help the annual migration of nearly 50 million crabs make their way to sea in order to spawn.",
                "The word 'cancer' is related to the Latin word for 'crab'. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted that the swollen tumors of cancer were similar to crab veins.",
                "Both the constellation Cancer and its corresponding astrological sign are named after and depicted as a crab.",
                "Most crabs' flat bodies allow them to squeeze into very narrow crevices.",
                "There are two kinds of crabs: true crabs, or brachyurans, and false crabs, or anomurans. Brachyurans use four long pairs of legs to walk, while anomurans have fewer walking legs and longer abdomens.",
                "Crabs have large compound eyes that are made up of hundreds of tiny lenses. With a total of 9 eyes, including these compound eyes and additional light receptors, they see incredibly well, even detecting small changes in motion on an ultraviolet level. They cannot, however, distinguish color.",
                "A crab can use its claws like a vice for crushing or like scissors for cutting. They can even be uses like chopsticks to pick up food.",
                "The smaller boxer crab will pick up and carry a pair of stinging anemones in its claws to use for protection.",
                "A crab's tough shell is also called a carapace.",
                "All crabs have smaller limbs beneath their mouths called maxillipede, known otherwise as 'foot-jaws' or 'gnathropodites'. They are used to help pull food into their bodies as well as for moving when close to the ground.",
                "The Sally Lightfoot, or red rock crab, is the most colorful crab in the world. It is red, orange, yellow, and white.",
                "Crabs live in more varied places than any other sea animal, including inhabiting smoking volcanic vents thousands of feet below the surface, as well as under the ice of Antartica. One type of crab even lives on land and climbs trees.",
                "The coconut crab is a giant hermit crab that lives on islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. It weights up to 10 pounds (4.5kg),  making it the world's largest land invertebrate.",
                "Some crabs, such as the spider crab, disguise themselves by attaching living things like anemones to their bodies. These fancy decorations serve both as camoflauge and as a stinging deterrent for predators.",
                "Crabs have a pair of eyes that protrude on stalks outwards from their bodies. Crabs can use these eyes to see anywhere around their bodies, including when they hide under water, rock, coral, sand or mud.",
                "Many crab species often work together to collect food and defend their group from predators.",
                "Crabs can move upwards of 12mi/h (19km/h) when travelling at top speed.",
                "True crabs' full scientific taxonomy is Animalia Arthropoda Crustacea Decapoda Brachyura.",
                "Instead of white blood cells, crabs have amebocytes, which attack foreign pathogens by trapping them in a viscous secretion that prevents spread. Since the late 1950s, these amebocytes are used to test vaccines and other drugs for safety. If amebocytes react aggresively to the product, researchers know that it's not ready for distribution due to the presence of bacteria."
